# Status Server
## Rules
Hey! Welcome to the Status server!

Here are the rules.

(Last updated: 29th September 2020)

1. Respect each other.
1a. Swearing is not permitted, unless you're using ||these beautiful things|| these beautiful things to filter it. Otherwise, @Status won't be happy. :(
1b. Be respectful to each other. There is no need for adjectives or nouns to describe each other. You can just say their username or user ID (if you have developer mode turned on), but don't ping them (e.g. do Sieve instead of @Sieve). Please don't @ everyone!
1c. No hate speech.
1d. Treat everyone the same. Don't treat anyone different based on their race, gender, age, sexuality or anything else.
1e. Please don't ping admins for support. 

2. Follow the Discord Ts&Cs and the law of your country.
2a. You must be over 13.
2b. No nudes, please. We're not interested.
2c. NSFW channels (which there are none of, but could be in the future (obviously without nudes)) are for 18+ only!
2d. Obviously, follow the law. Don't reveal that Boris is a part of the Illuminati.

3. Use the correct channels and remember that this server is mainly for talking about our bot!
3a. Use #general for general chat about the bot, #off-topic for stuff that isn't about the bot, and #filterless to talk about whatever you want!
(3a1. Quick note! In #filterless, swearing is allowed, but if it doesn't follow rules 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e and all of 2, we'll take swift action and block that channel from the public for 24 hours.)
3b. There are no support channels. To reduce clutter, we use @ModMail. Learn more in #info.
3c. Although you can talk about other stuff here and there, we'd prefer you to speak mainly about the bot.
(3c1. Another quick note here! Obviously, you can talk about anything in #off-topic!)

4. Have fun! Enjoy the server!
